ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hydegustaman
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and coding, well all sort of tech things too.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (combined).
ðŸ“« If happens when you find my codes has an error, or lack of creativity, or maybe has similarity with someone else's code feel free to email me at eggustaman1981@outlook.com I'll be happy to respons it.
 ...

Now, about this project. 

I call it # Loading-Spinner #
Some colorful loading animation, to ease your mind when the internet is buffering.
This time, the CSS codes are builded in-line within the HTML. You might already noticed it when you see there's only one .html file in this repo.

Have A Nice Day!!
